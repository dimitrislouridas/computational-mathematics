# Numerical Analysis Algorithms (Python)

This repository contains implementations of fundamental **numerical analysis algorithms**
developed as part of an academic course in Numerical Analysis.

The project focuses on translating mathematical theory into working software,
with emphasis on correctness, convergence behavior and clean algorithmic structure.

## Topics Covered

- Polynomial evaluation and Taylor approximations
- Numerical integration techniques
- Linear system solvers and matrix decompositions
- Monte Carlo simulation methods
- Interpolation techniques

## Key Features
- Modular Python implementations of numerical algorithms
- Configurable parameters (tolerance, iterations, step size)
- Visualization of functions and convergence behavior using Matplotlib
- Focus on algorithm stability and numerical accuracy

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Matplotlib
